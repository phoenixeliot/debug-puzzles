      Open up the devtools to find the secret.<br />
      Mac: cmd-option-i<br />
      Windows/Linux: ctrl-alt-i<br />
      <br />
      Then refresh the page.<br />
      <br />
      If the debugger pauses without showing you the correct code, click the
      first entry in the Call Stack to jump to where it's really paused. This
      usually only happens the first time we pause on a given page.<br />
      <br />
      For this page, use the Call Stack section of the dev tools.<br />
      Note that the call stack in the dev tools is "upside down" compared to how
      people usually refer to call stack directions â€” going "up" the call stack
      means going towards the first function that was called, away from the most
      recent. In the devtools, the first function is listed at the bottom, so
      going "up" means going further down the list shown there.<br />
      This is backwards mainly because you usually care about seeing the bottom
      of the call stack (most recently called function) first.<br />
      If the direction you read somewhere is confusing, you'll have to just
      infer from context what they mean.
