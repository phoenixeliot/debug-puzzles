      Open up DevTools to find a secret password.<br />
      Mac: Cmd-Option-I<br />
      Windows/Linux: Ctrl-Shift-I<br />
      <br />
      Then refresh the page.<br />
      <br />
      If the debugger pauses without showing you the correct code, click the first 
      entry in the Call Stack to jump to where it's really paused. This usually only 
      happens the first time we pause on a given page.
      <br />
      For this page, use the Call Stack section. Note that the call stack in the debugger 
      is "upside down" if compared to the way people usually refer to call stack directions. 
      Going "up" the call stack means going towards the first function that was called and 
      away from the most recent. In the debugger, the first function is listed at the bottom, 
      so going "up" means going further down the list shown there.
      <br />
      Usually, we care about seeing the bottom of the call stack (most recently called function) 
      first. If the direction you read somewhere is confusing, you can infer from context what they mean.
